## Introduction

The application is a web-based platform designed specifically for developers who are focused on UX design and require enhanced control over their design processes with AI assistance. The platform empowers developers by allowing them to design user experiences both locally and securely. It integrates advanced AI technologies to provide user experience design suggestions while maintaining the privacy of the developers' data. Developers can choose between integrating with a local Ollama instance or a specified remote API to leverage large language model (LLM) capabilities, ensuring enhanced customization and control. This platform ultimately aims to provide a feature-rich environment where developers can manage their design projects effectively, using AI-powered tools to streamline their workflows.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Uers are directed to the Project Page, which serves as the main hub for managing different design projects. This centralizes the user’s project management experience by displaying all active, archived, and new projects in an organized format. The Project Page includes a sidebar for navigation, featuring quick links to start a new project or access the Design Dashboard, Settings Page, and other essential features. At the top, a header bar provides access to the user's profile, notifications, and help section.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

After selecting a project from the Project Page, users proceed to the Design Dashboard, which is the primary workspace for interaction with AI tools and design elements. The dashboard integrates an AI-powered interface where developers can input project criteria and obtain AI-generated design suggestions and code snippets tailored to their specifications. This workspace includes a code editor for manual coding adjustments, a real-time preview area where design changes are instantly reflected, and a chat window for direct interaction with AI models.

Developers can explore and apply design templates available within the dashboard for rapid prototyping. Also available is an export tool that allows users to save their finalized designs as code, facilitating easy integration into larger development projects. Transitioning between different areas of the platform, such as returning to the Project Page or accessing new project templates, is seamless and user-friendly through the navigation sidebar.

## Settings and Account Management

The platform offers a Settings Page where users can configure their preferences for AI model integration — allowing them to choose between local Ollama instances or remote API usage. Users can also manage other settings including app parameters, notification preferences, and exporting configurations. The settings interface is intuitive, enabling users to quickly adapt their user experience according to their workflow requirements. After modifications, users can effortlessly return to the Design Dashboard or the Project Page, ensuring a smooth and continuous design process.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

In cases where users encounter issues such as lost internet connectivity, entering invalid data, or attempting to access restricted features, the application is designed to handle these errors gracefully. Error messages are informative yet non-intrusive, providing users clear instructions on how to recover or correct their actions. Users experiencing connectivity issues are informed through alerts, ensuring that they can pause and resume their work without data loss. If users interact with the AI tools incorrectly or provide unsupported input, the application suggests corrections or displays alternative functionalities that serve their needs.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The journey through the application begins with an easy and secure sign-up process, leading users to a well-organized Project Page where they can manage all their design projects. Transitioning to the Design Dashboard, they are equipped with developer-centric AI tools that enhance their UX design capabilities. With options for local AI execution or remote integration, developers enjoy a flexible and secure workflow that respects their data privacy. Throughout the session, users can adjust settings as needed and, in the event of errors, receive guided assistance to maintain productivity. This seamless journey empowers developers to efficiently create and refine UX designs, culminating in complete or in-progress projects ready for deployment or further development.
