# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The project is a platform specifically designed to empower developers in creating and implementing user experiences with the aid of AI. This tool stands out by allowing developers to run their design processes locally, which promises enhanced privacy and greater customization. Users can choose to integrate with a local Ollama instance or a specified remote API to leverage large language model (LLM) capabilities. This approach caters to developers wishing for stringent control over their workflows and data privacy in a feature-rich environment that integrates AI effectively.

The platform is being built to target developers involved in UX design, offering them enhanced tools for better design outcomes. Key objectives include robust AI-driven design support, flexibility in AI integration (local and remote), and a user-centric interface that provides control over design processes without compromising privacy. Success for the platform is measured by its ability to support diverse development environments, secure data handling, and high satisfaction from a target audience who demand precision and customization in their design work.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   AI-Powered UX design tool with input from GPT-4o and similar models.
*   Choice of local or remote LLM integration for AI processing.
*   Developer-centric features including code generation and export.
*   Design Dashboard including a real-time preview, code editor, and AI chat.
*   Settings Page for AI and app configuration.
*   Local execution support across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   Support for developer tools like VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Non-design related AI functionalities or extensions.
*   Mobile application versions of the platform.
*   Real-time collaboration features beyond basic access control (Admin, Developer, Guest).
*   Monetization models outside subscription and one-time purchase options.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user, such as a developer focusing on UX design, logs into the platform and arrives at the Project Page. Here, they can view and manage their existing design projects or initiate a new one. Once a project is chosen, they proceed to the Design Dashboard, the main workspace where they can interact with AI-assisted design tools. The dashboard presents a code editor, a real-time preview pane, and a chat window for engaging with the AI. Design templates are available for quick prototyping, and users can export their designs at any point.

Users can adjust their AI interaction preferences on the Settings Page, where they choose between local or remote AI processing and modify other application parameters to suit their needs. Throughout the design session, changes reflect immediately in the preview area, and the focus remains on local execution to ensure privacy. By session’s end, developers have a refined design ready for further testing or deployment, all managed through an intuitive, developer-friendly interface.

## 4. Core Features

*   **AI-Powered UX Design**: Integration with AI models like GPT-4o for design suggestions.
*   **Local/Remote LLM Integration**: Flexibility to use local Ollama instances or remote APIs.
*   **Customizable Design Tools**: Tools that offer code generation, design templates, and export capabilities.
*   **Real-Time Design Updates**: Instantaneous updates and previews on the dashboard.
*   **Settings Page**: Configurations for AI integration and application preferences.
*   **In-memory Storage and File System**: Local data management ensuring fast access and privacy.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/UI, Radix UI, Lucide Icons
*   **Backend**: Local in-memory storage and file system
*   **AI Models**: GPT-4o and Ollama for LLM capabilities
*   **Tools**: V0 by Vercel, Claude AI, Cursor AI, Lovable, Bolt
*   **IDEs**: Support for Cursor and Windsurf for enhanced development experience

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance**: Fast, local execution ensuring low latency in design updates.
*   **Security**: Enhanced privacy with the option for local AI model execution.
*   **Usability**: Intuitive UI/UX catering to developers.
*   **Scalability**: Capable of scaling from local execution to remote API use for diverse workloads.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Local Execution**: Assumes availability of sufficient hardware resources for local AI models.
*   **Data Privacy**: Emphasis on local data processing unless specified by user through remote APIs.
*   **User Roles**: Minimal roles, focusing on Developer, Admin, and Guest access.
*   **Compliance**: GDPR considerations assumed under the user's control for remote data interactions.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Hardware Variability**: Challenge in ensuring local AI models run efficiently across diverse systems.

    *   **Mitigation**: Include hardware optimization settings and robust documentation.

*   **Model Update Complexity**: Seamless updates for local models are critical.

    *   **Mitigation**: Implement reliable, straightforward update mechanisms within the app.

*   **Privacy Configurations**: Overseeing strict user-data handling without external logging.

    *   **Mitigation**: Default to secure local processing, educating users on remote risks.

The construction of this PRD aims to ensure clarity and completeness, serving as the central guide for developing a platform that meets the demanding needs of privacy-conscious, developer-focused UX design.
